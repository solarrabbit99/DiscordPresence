# Discord Presence

This is a just-for-fun Rich Presence application... for Discord...

## System Requirements

I developed and tested the application on MacOS, so yes, this is pretty much meant for only MacOS users. It _may_ work on other systems given that an instance of Discord is running when running the executable.

## How to Use

> **PLEASE DO NOT RUN IT WHEN DISCORD IS STARTING UP, YOU ARE WARNED**

1. Download from release
2. Double click it
3. Done!

This can be done with or without Discord running. Have fun!
