# Discord Presence

This is a just-for-fun Rich Presence application... for Discord...

## System Requirements

I developed and tested the application on MacOS, so yes, this is pretty much meant for only MacOS users. It _may_ work on other systems given that an instance of Discord is running when running the executable.

## How to Use

> **PLEASE DO NOT RUN THE EXECUTABLE WHEN DISCORD IS STARTING UP, YOU ARE WARNED**

1. Clone the repository
2. (Recommended) Create a `build` folder in the project's directory
3. Run `cmake ..` in the `build` directory
4. In the same directory, run `make`
5. An executable named `DiscordPresence` will be generated in the build directory

The executable can be run with or without Discord running. Have fun!
